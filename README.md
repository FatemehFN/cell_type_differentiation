# Cell Type Differentiation Using Network Clustering Algorithms

This repository contains code and analysis for the paper _"Cell Type Differentiation Using Network Clustering Algorithms"_, which compares the performance of several graph-based clustering methods in identifying cell types from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.

## üß¨ Project Overview

We apply multiple community detection algorithms on similarity graphs derived from scRNA-seq data to benchmark how well they recover known cell types. This framework allows systematic comparison of modularity-based and probabilistic clustering approaches, including their runtime efficiency.
